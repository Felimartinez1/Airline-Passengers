# Airline-Passengers
In this project I have been analyzing the satisfaction or dissatisfaction of passengers in an airline, therefore I have made many comparisons, trying to find correlations and causalities to take into account what makes a passenger enjoy their flight. Finally, I have made a neural network that predicts with 96.1% accuracy when a passenger is satisfied or not with the service.
